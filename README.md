## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

## My process

I wanted to continue using tailwind and react in this project but add the slight difficulty of TS. So I created the project using the typescript template. 
Typescript is proving to be pretty difficult to get my mind wrapped around, and it's a 100% something I'm going to need to build a couple projects with before I understand it. 



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
-[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For Type Safety


### What I learned
I learned that tailwind doesn't support dynamic creation of the classes with string interpolation so I had to write a couple of functions to return the desired colors, sizes etc. 


### Continued development
Somethings I would change if I could would be the image shifting the page when the geology tab is clicked, so I will need to look into maybe setting minimum heights on the containers in order to keep them consistently shaped.
